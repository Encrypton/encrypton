Issues that were resolved:

-Finding the software that we will use for encryption

-How to securly encrypt files that when decrypted can be accessed on any system.

-An ideal solution to this would be to use a small windows computer, since it can enable and disable bitlocker. But it is very expensive

- We are using CryptSetup to encrypt the drives
